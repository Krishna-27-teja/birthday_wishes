                HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU ANKITAA.It is still hard to believe its almost six months and you are not
                here!!!It's hard to believe that those memories google drive shares are last years.I do miss going to
                J3/18 whenever i get bored or when I bought new clothes.So many things changed and yet nothing changed
                between us.I tried writting you letter but stayed in head and when i actually starts to write I could
                not find words.Like there is so much to tell you,and know your views and then super excited say haan
                exactly same, bola thaa na etc. I hope someday you come to jabalpur again and I take you on a scooty
                ride and visit your childhood place and we might end up realizing that we must have been to one place
                around same time.But we met here in this place which where we all as a team learnt so many
                things,commited mistakes but stayed with each other.Because once you said "Dost banane ke liye dosti
                nibhani bhi padthi hai". I felt it 100%.

                everyone you have been a good listner,but for me your presence matters a bit more than your words.The
                best part about you&me was my heat on your lap your hug often makes me calm down.</p>

                </div>It was a round 12 pm midnight suddenly our twitter servers are getting hanged and whole team went
                haywire not sure of whats going on in twitter.Since I fired few people when I bought twitter, I was
                actually bit panicked about you know loosing money and stuff.There were whole lot of birthday wishes may
                be the first time we took a hit because of the numerous data flow coming in. The craze for her is
                inexplicable. I wish her happy,prosperous and successfull year ahead.We at spaceX are banging our heads
                to discover the brightest stars around the sky. We probably didn't look in Orissa.Haha...</p>

                <p>I really believe people should posses some sort of empathy. I really think she has great empathy
                    towards people,. When it comes to successfull leadership I think thats what matters the most. I know
                    she is preparing to be one of the best leaders, so I wish her all the best. May she be the heroine
                    of her own successfull dreams.</p>
